This file explain how to install TurtleBots using Makefile

Short way:
    make
    make install

you can change the "prefix" (by default "/usr/local")
or any other vartiables of instalation
For example to intall in /home/myhome type this
    make
    make prefix=/home/myhome install

The Makefile meets the GNU standards (or at least most of them)
sow you can change the default installation variables...
    prefix = /usr/local
    bindir = /usr/local/bin
    datarootdir = /usr/local/share
    datadir = /usr/local/share
    sysconfdir = /usr/local/etc
    docdir = /usr/local/share/doc/tortubots
    infodir = /usr/local/share/info
    localedir = /usr/local/share/locale

    xo : Generate the XO distribuible package
    dev: compile all necessary for TurtleArtButia
                 and make a developed sugar install
                 this allow to work and easy change the code
    install: install activity

    updatepo: using notraslated.pot update the es.po of plugin's
              the other traslations all already set in mainline
